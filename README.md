# Abstract-Network-Visualizations

Here are collected all results of the method presented in the thesis "*M. Bianchi, A. De Santis: A Human-in-the-Loop Approach for Post-hoc Explainability of CNN-based Image Classification*". All images used for the experiment are collected in the folder "Images"

## Local Explanations

All local explanations are collected in the folder "Local Explanations". To ease the visualization, we created the file "explainer.html", from which it is possible to select the desired class, an image of the class and whether to see the results with or without merging the cluster maps.

## Global Explanations

All explanations are collected in the folder "Global Explanations" as images.
