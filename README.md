# Abstract-Network-Visualizations

All results obtained in the thesis "*M. Bianchi, A. De Santis: A Human-in-the-Loop Approach for Post-hoc Explainability of CNN-based Image Classification*" are provided in this repository including ANVs and Global Explanations. Original images used for the experiment are collected in the folder "Images".

## Abstract Network Visualizations (Local Explanations)

All Abstract Network Visualizations are collected in the folder "Local Explanations". To ease the visualization, we created the file "explainer.html", from which it is possible to select a class of interest, an image of the class and whether to see the results with or without merging the cluster maps on labels.

## Global Explanations

All global explanations are collected in the folder "Global Explanations", including the simple and straightforward ones that combine all layers together.
